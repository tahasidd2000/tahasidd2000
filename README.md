🚀 **Current Focus:**
I'm actively working on web development projects and delving into the intricacies of AI. On weekends, you'll find me immersing myself in a blend of front-end development, back-end technologies, solid computer science concepts, and AI, with a touch of competitive coding on LeetCode and Hackerrank.

🧠 **Learning Journey:**
I enjoy the continuous learning process. Whether it's mastering JavaScript, C++, Python, or exploring the depths of data engineering and machine learning, weekends are dedicated to absorbing new knowledge.

🤝 **Open for Collaboration:**
I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on projects related to web development, data engineering, and machine learning. If you have exciting ideas or projects, let's connect and create something amazing!

⚡ **Fun Fact:**
Outside the coding realm, I have a keen interest in football, not just playing but also analyzing the game. History documentaries are another favorite pastime.

**Skills:**
JavaScript | C++ | Python | Java | HTML5 | React | CSS3 | Bootstrap | MySQL
